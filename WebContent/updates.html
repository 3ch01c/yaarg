<h1>Latest Updates</h1>
<span class="date">12/4/2010-12/5/2010</span>
<ul>
	<li>Everyone: Everything.</li>
</ul>
<span class="date">12/1/2010</span>
<ul>
	<li>James: Character list is working again.</li>
	<li>James: GameCharacter class updated with two new methods for getting characters.<br />
		To get a list of characters for an account:<br />
		<span class="code" style="margin: 15px;">ArrayList&lt;GameCharacter&gt; characters = GameCharacter.listCharacters(email);</span><br />
		To get a single character based on an id:<br />
		<span class="code" style="margin: 15px;">GameCharacter character = GameCharacter.getCharacter(id)</span></li>
        <li>Marc: Quest.java and QuestLog.java were added</li>
        <li>Marc: NPC method added within GameCharacter.java</li>
</ul>
<span class="date">11/24/2010</span>
<ul>
	<li>James: Added inventory and quest log windows to world view. Just press 'i' or 'q' to open/close them while focused on the map. The buttons don't actually work yet.</li>
</ul>
<span class="date">11/23/2010</span>
<ul>
	<li>James: DBConnection.java added. Start using <span class="code">DBConnection.getConnection()</span> instead of <span class="code">DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://wernicke.homeftp.net:3306/it321", "it321dba","it321DBA");</span>.</li>
	<li>James: Fixed battle.html so it didn't make scroll bars. (CanvasContainer had a fixed width that was too wide.)</li>
	<li>James: Change login button to enable as soon as anything is typed in password field for you tabber types.</li>
	<li>James: Changed userHome.jsp (Added iframe for characters.jsp)</li>
	<li>James: Changed login.jsp back to load userHome.jsp to improve performance. The GameServlet is now called in the new iframe in userHome.jsp which then loads up characters.jsp. This way, userHome can load while waiting for characters to be loaded.</li>
	<li>James: Character creation page works!</li>
	<li>James: Changed Character to GameCharacter so there's no ambiguity with the built-in Character object.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>David D.: Changed userHome.jsp to include divs for displaying
	characters and character details</li>
	<li>David D.: Right now, I hard coded my email so it pulls my one
	character and sets a button for him and when you click it, it displays
	the character's details</li>
	<li>David D.: I hardcoded my email so that everyone can see a
	character (because not everyone has one) and because I'm unable to get
	to the session variables. My name even stopped being displayed...
	James?</li>
